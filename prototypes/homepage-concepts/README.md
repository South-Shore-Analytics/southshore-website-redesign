## Design Decision Rationale

### Why 3 Different Approaches?

**Concept 1 (Bold):** Tests appetite for dramatic, immersive experiences
**Concept 2 (Balanced):** Tests preference for clean, minimal, SaaS-style design
**Concept 3 (Blueprint):** Tests differentiation through unique aesthetic and systematic positioning

This range ensures stakeholders can provide meaningful feedback and helps identify which aspects resonate most (animation complexity, color intensity, layout density, etc.).
