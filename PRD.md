## Deliverables

- [ ] 3 homepage design concepts (HTML prototypes)
- [ ] Design system (colors, typography, components)
- [ ] Website roadmap

### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 3-5)

## Out of Scope (Phase 2)
- Blog/content marketing platform
- Client portal
- Advanced configurators
- E-commerce functionality

## Design System Preview
(To be developed in context/style-guide.md)
- Primary color: TBD (likely nautical blue for lighthouse theme)
- Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Manrope, or similar)
- Spacing: 8px base unit
- Border radius: 8-12px
- Animations: 150-300ms, ease-in-out

## Questions to Resolve
1. What specific case studies can we feature?
2. Do we have client testimonials/logos we can use?
3. What's the approved budget for custom illustrations/animations?
4. Timeline for content creation (copy, images)?
5. Who will manage the CMS after launch?

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** SEO traffic drop during migration
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive redirect strategy, gradual rollout
- **Risk:** Overly complex animations hurt performance
  - **Mitigation:** Performance budgets, lazy loading, reduced motion support
- **Risk:** Scope creep on design iterations
  - **Mitigation:** Limit to 3 homepage concepts, 2 rounds of revisions

## Approval Process
1. Homepage concepts → Chris/James/Nick review
2. Selected design → Full development
3. Staging site → Final stakeholder approval
4. Launch → Post-launch monitoring (2 weeks)
