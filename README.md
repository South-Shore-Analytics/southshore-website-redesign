## üé® The Lighthouse Hero Concept

### Visual Metaphor
An animated hero section where **distance from the lighthouse represents stage of data maturity:**

**Far Away (Background):**  
Choppy waters, struggling ship = **Data Chaos**  
- Raw data in spreadsheets
- Siloed reporting
- Manual processes
- Can't find answers when you need them

**Navigating (Midground):**  
Ship moving forward, passing obstacles = **Data Organization**  
- Common obstacles: Data silos, quality issues, governance gaps
- Building infrastructure
- Connecting sources

**Arriving (Foreground):**  
Calm waters near lighthouse = **Data Maturity**  
- Diagnostic ‚Üí Predictive analytics
- Automated insights
- Confident decision-making

### Key Message
> "Every business is unique, but their data problems often aren't."

We've guided many companies through these same challenges. The lighthouse represents both our expertise and the destination.

### Implementation Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **Concept is solid, execution needs work**  
Current prototypes have the animation but it needs refinement in:
- Animation smoothness and timing
- Visual polish and detail
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance optimization

## üéØ Phase 2 Success Criteria (Not Yet Met)

We're aiming for:

- [ ] **Lighthouse Animation:** Smooth, engaging, tells the story clearly
- [ ] **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliant (currently at ~85%)
- [ ] **Performance:** 90+ Lighthouse score (current prototypes: ~75-80)

- [ ] **Stakeholder Approval:** James, Nick, and team aligned on direction

**Current Reality:** Prototypes are functional but need significant polish before stakeholder review.
